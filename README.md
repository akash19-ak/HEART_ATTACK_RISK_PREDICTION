# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## 💡 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical data. The goal is to build a model that can help in early detection, leading to preventive healthcare measures.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
https://github.com/akash19-ak/HEART_ATTACK_RISK_PREDICTION/blob/main/heart.csv

The project uses a publicly available dataset for heart disease prediction, which includes medical features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- ECG Results
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- And more...

## 🧹 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing data and outliers.
   - Data normalization and scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing key features with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Correlation analysis to find important features.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained multiple models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, etc.)
   - Chose the best-performing model based on results.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-attack-risk-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the **Heart_Attack_Prediction.ipynb** notebook and follow the steps in the code.

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide a simple tool that can help identify individuals at risk of heart disease and encourage early intervention through medical consultation and lifestyle changes.
